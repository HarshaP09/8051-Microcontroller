# **Switches and LEDs Interfacing with 8051**

## Overview
This project demonstrates interfacing switches and LEDs with the 8051 microcontroller.  
When a switch is pressed, the corresponding LED turns ON; otherwise, the LED remains OFF. This forms the basic building block for understanding digital input/output (I/O) handling with microcontrollers.

##  Circuit Connections
* Input (Switches) → Port 1 (P1.0 – P1.7)  
  * Connected with pull-up resistors (default HIGH, goes LOW when pressed).  
* Output (LEDs) → Port 2 (P2.0 – P2.7)  
  * Each LED corresponds to a switch.

## Theory – Switch & LED Interfacing
* **Switches:** Act as digital inputs (logic HIGH = not pressed, logic LOW = pressed).  
* **LEDs:** Act as digital outputs (ON when logic HIGH is applied).  
* **Logic:** When a switch is pressed → input detected → corresponding LED is activated.

## Expected Output
1. All LEDs remain OFF when no switches are pressed.  
2. If a switch is pressed (e.g., Switch 1), the corresponding LED (LED 1) turns ON.  
3. Multiple switches can be pressed simultaneously, and the corresponding LEDs will glow.
