# **DC Motor Interfacing with 8051**

## Overview
This project demonstrates DC motor control using the 8051 microcontroller.  
Two variations are implemented:
1. **Simple DC Motor Run** – Motor runs continuously in a single direction.  
2. **DC Motor Controlled by Switches** – Motor operation (start, stop, direction, and speed) is controlled using input switches with PWM (duty cycle variation).

## Circuit Connections

### Code-1 (Simple Motor Run)
* Enable Pin (EN1) → P2.0  
* Input Pins (IN1, IN2) → P2.4, P2.5 (controls motor direction via H-Bridge).  
* DC Motor** connected via driver (L293D).  


### Code-2 (Motor with Switch Control)
* Switches (Active LOW):  
  * Start → P1.0  
  * Reverse → P1.1  
  * Increase Speed → P1.2  
  * Decrease Speed → P1.3  
  * Stop → P1.4  
* Motor Control Pins** same as above (EN1 = P2.0, IN1 = P2.4, IN2 = P2.5).  
* PWM Duty Cycle** is adjusted to vary motor speed.

## Theory
* **DC Motor Control**: Requires driver circuits like L293D to handle higher current.  
 A DC motor is an electromechanical device that converts direct current (DC) electrical energy into mechanical rotational energy. It works on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a mechanical force.  
In a DC motor, when current flows through the armature winding inside the magnetic field created by permanent magnets or field windings, a torque is generated that causes the rotor to rotate. The direction of rotation can be controlled by changing the polarity of the supply or using driver circuits such as an H-bridge. 
* **L293D**  
  The L293D is a motor driver IC designed to control the direction and speed of DC motors and stepper motors in embedded systems. It is a dual H-bridge motor driver, meaning it can drive two motors simultaneously in both forward and reverse directions. Each H-bridge consists of transistors arranged in a way that allows current to flow in either direction through the motor, enabling bidirectional control.  
 It also has enable pins to control motor ON/OFF states and supports pulse-width modulation (PWM) for speed regulation. Internally, the L293D includes diodes for back EMF protection, which safeguard the IC from voltage spikes generated by motors.

## Expected Output
* **Code-1**:  
  - Motor starts running immediately in forward direction and keeps running continuously.  

* **Code-2**:  
  1. Press **Start Switch** → Motor starts running.  
  2. Press **Stop Switch** → Motor stops.  
  3. Press **Increase Speed** → Motor speed increases gradually.  
  4. Press **Decrease Speed** → Motor speed decreases gradually.  
  5. Press **Reverse Switch** → Motor changes direction of rotation.
