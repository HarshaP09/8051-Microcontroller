# **7-Segment Display with 8051**

## Overview
This project demonstrates interfacing a **7-segment display** with the 8051 microcontroller to display digits **0–9 sequentially**.  
It helps in understanding digital display driving, lookup tables, and GPIO-based interfacing.

## Circuit Connections
* Port P2* Connected to 7-segment display segments (a–g + DP)  
* P0.0 to dis1 (Digit Select 1)  
* P0.1 to dis2 (Digit Select 2)  
* P0.2 to dis3 (Digit Select 3)  
* P0.3 to dis4 (Digit Select 4)  

In this setup, all digit select lines are enabled together, so the same digit appears on all displays.

## Theory  
A **7-segment display** is a simple output device used for displaying decimal numbers.  
It consists of seven LEDs arranged as segments (labeled a–g) and an optional decimal point (DP).  

- **Common Cathode (CC):** All cathodes connected to GND, segments turn ON when given logic HIGH.  
- **Common Anode (CA):** All anodes connected to VCC, segments turn ON when given logic LOW.  
This project uses **Common Anode** configuration, as the program sends inverted (`~`) values to display digits.

## Expected Output
- The display will show numbers **0–9 in sequence**, one after another.  
- All four digits will show the **same number at the same time**.  
- After 9, the cycle restarts from 0.
