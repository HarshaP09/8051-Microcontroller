# **LED Blinking using 8051**

## Description
This project demonstrates different LED blinking patterns (all ON/OFF, alternate, nibble-wise, and counting) using the 8051 microcontroller.

## Connections
* Port P0 is Connected to LEDs via current-limiting resistors.
* VCC (5V) to LED + Resistor
* GND to Common ground

## Theory
LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) emit light when current flows through them.  In microcontroller systems, LEDs are used for status indication, debugging, and visualization of digital outputs.

## Expected Output
*  All LEDs turn ON and OFF together.
* Alternate LEDs blink.
* Upper and lower nibbles blink alternately.
*  LEDs count from 00 to FF.
